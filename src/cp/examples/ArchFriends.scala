 * Description :
 *
 * Harriet, upon returning from the mall, is happily describing her
 * four shoe purchases to her friend Aurora. Aurora just loves the four
 * different kinds of shoes that Harriet bought (ecru espadrilles,
 * fuchsia flats, purple pumps, and suede sandals), but Harriet can't
 * recall at which different store (Foot Farm, Heels in a Handcart, The
 * Shoe Palace, or Tootsies) she got each pair. Can you help these two
 * figure out the order in which Harriet bought each pair of shoes, and
 * where she bought each?
